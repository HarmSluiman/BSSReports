<p>The purpose of this site is to provide dynamically generated graphics that show trends based on the concepts presented on the
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.forentrepreneurs.com/">for Entrepreneurs.com</a> web site.
</p>
<p>The eventual support will provide two methods of data input. Live through this browser interface, and via a web service request 
that will return a url to a generated set of reports that can be further refined dynamically.
</p>
<p>A overview of the concept can be seen in a sequence of pages starting
