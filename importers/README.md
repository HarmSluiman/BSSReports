...This project carries the code and test data used to develop a SaaS service for business dashboarding
that is focused on SaaS services. This is done based on concepts discussed at http://www.forentrepreneurs.com/


## Usage
...The basic concept is that a user provides data via json and eventually xls, or interactively to produce a data set.
The data set is then parsed and embellished for the various potential reports.
...The reports are generated as html pages and the graphics are driven by data selected via a Profile.json file. 
The user can submit Profile.json files and is provided with a default set that driven the generation process.
...All the generated files are pushed to a public director on the web server and can be easily referenced in a larger dashboard..
This project also contains several higher level examples of dashboard summary pages that can be reused as needed.


## Developing
...Currently this project is in early development and copyright protected until the base is ready for release at which time it 
is planned to be open sourced under the MIT or Eclipse license model.
